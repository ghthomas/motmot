\title{Tree plotting for rates
Plots trees with colours based on rates of trait evolution. Also provides simple coloured plotting for trait values using the "ace" function in the ape library.}
\usage{
plotPhylo.motmot(phy, x = NULL, traitMedusaObject = NULL,
  reconType = "rates", type = "phylogram", use.edge.length = TRUE,
  show.tip.label = TRUE, show.node.label = FALSE, edge.color = "black",
  edge.width = 1, edge.lty = 1, font = 3, cex = par("cex"),
  adj = NULL, srt = 0, no.margin = FALSE, root.edge = FALSE,
  label.offset = 0.5, underscore = FALSE, x.lim = NULL, y.lim = NULL,
  direction = "rightwards", lab4ut = "horizontal", tip.color = "black",
  palette = "hotspot.colors")
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{An object of class "phylo" (see ape package).}

\item{x}{A matrix of trait values.}

\item{traitMedusaObject}{Output from traitMedusaSummary.}

\item{reconType}{Colour branches according to rate shifts ("rates" - requires traitMedusaObject) or ancestral state reconstruction ("picReconstruction"  - requires x).}

\item{type}{a character string specifying the type of phylogeny to be drawn; it must be one of "phylogram" (the default), "cladogram", "fan", "unrooted", "radial" or any unambiguous abbreviation of these.}

\item{use.edge.length}{a logical indicating whether to use the edge lengths of the phylogeny to draw the branches (the default) or not (if \code{FALSE}). This option has no effect if the object of class \code{"phylo"} has no `edge.length' element.}

\item{show.tip.label}{a logical indicating whether to show the tip labels on the phylogeny (defaults to \code{TRUE}, i.e. the labels are shown).}

\item{show.node.label}{a logical indicating whether to show the node labels on the phylogeny (defaults to \code{FALSE}, i.e. the labels are not shown).}

\item{edge.color}{a vector of mode character giving the colours used to draw the branches of the plotted phylogeny. These are taken to be in the same order than the component \code{edge} of \code{phy}. If fewer colours are given than the length of \code{edge}, then the colours are recycled.}

\item{edge.width}{a numeric vector giving the width of the branches of the plotted phylogeny. These are taken to be in the same order than the component \code{edge} of \code{phy}. If fewer widths are given than the length of \code{edge}, then these are recycled.}

\item{edge.lty}{same than the previous argument but for line types; 1: plain, 2: dashed, 3: dotted, 4: dotdash, 5: longdash, 6: twodash.}

\item{font}{an integer specifying the type of font for the labels: 1 (plain text), 2 (bold), 3 (italic, the default), or 4 (bold italic).}

\item{cex}{a numeric value giving the factor scaling of the tip and node labels (Character EXpansion). The default is to take the current value from the graphical parameters.}

\item{srt}{a numeric giving how much the labels are rotated in degrees (negative values are allowed resulting in clock-like rotation); the value has an effect respectively to the value of \code{direction} (see Examples). This option has no effect if \code{type = "unrooted"}.}

\item{no.margin}{a logical. If \code{TRUE}, the margins are set to zero and the plot uses all the space of the device (note that this was the behaviour of \code{plot.phylo} up to version 0.2-1 of `ape' with no way to modify it by the user, at least easily).}

\item{label.offset}{a numeric giving the space between the nodes and the tips of the phylogeny and their corresponding labels. This option has no effect if \code{type = "unrooted"}.}

\item{underscore}{a logical specifying whether the underscores in tip labels should be written as spaces (the default) or left as are (if\code{TRUE}).}

\item{x.lim}{a numeric vector of length one or two giving the limit(s) of the x-axis. If \code{NULL}, this is computed with respect to various parameters such as the string lengths of the labels and the branch lengths. If a single value is given, this is taken as the upper limit.}

\item{y.lim}{same than above for the y-axis.}

\item{direction}{a character string specifying the direction of the tree. Four values are possible: "rightwards" (the default),"leftwards", "upwards", and "downwards".}

\item{lab4ut}{(= labels for unrooted trees) a character string specifying the display of tip labels for unrooted trees: either \code{"horizontal"} where all labels are horizontal (the default), or \code{"axial"} where the labels are displayed in the axis of the corresponding terminal branches. This option has an effect only if \code{type = "unrooted"}.}

\item{tip.color}{the colours used for the tip labels, eventually recycled (see examples).}

\item{palette}{Defines the colour scheme with four options: hotspot.colors (red to blue), heat.colors (yellow to red), cool.colors (blues), combi.colors (yellows to reds and blues)}

\item{adj}{a}{numeric specifying the justification of the text strings of the labels: 0 (left-justification), 0.5 (centering), or 1 (right-justification). This option has no effect if \code{type ="unrooted"}. If \code{NULL} (the default) the value is set with respect of \code{direction} (see details).}

\item{root.edgea}{logical indicating whether to draw the root edge (defaults to FALSE); this has no effect if `use.edge.length = FALSE' or if `type = "unrooted"'.}
}
