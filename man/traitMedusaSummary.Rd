\description{
Summarises phenotypic rate variation on phylogenies.
}
\details{
This functions summarises the output of a "medusa" model in transformPhylo.ML (see below). The best overall model is chosen based on AIC (or AICc if AICc=TRUE). The cut-off point for improvement in AIC score between successively more complex models can be defined using cutoff. The default cutoff is 4 but this is somewhat arbitrary and a "good" cut-off may well vary between data sets so it may well be worth exploring different cutoffs.
Summarises fits of "medusa" models ("clade" models generated without any a priori assertion of the location of phenotypic diversification rate shifts). It uses the same approach as the runMedusa function in the geiger package (runMedusa tests for shifts in the rate of lineage diversification). The algorithm first fits a constant-rate Brownian model to the data, it then works iteratively through the phylogeny fitting a two-rate model at each node in turn. Each two-rate model is compared to the constant rate model and the best two-rate model is retained. Keeping the location of this rate shift intact, it then repeats the procedure for a three-rate model and so on. The maximum number of rate shifts can be specified a priori using nSplits. Limits can also be applied to the size (species richness) of clades on which to infer new rate shifts using minCladeSize. This can be useful to enable large trees to be handled but should be used cautiously since specifiying a large minimum clade size may result in biologically interesting nested rate shifts being missed. Equally, very small clade sizes may provide poor estimates of rate that may not be informative.
