Gavin notes a problem in transformPhylo.ML 'tm2' - what exactly?
covPIC = covariance for multi-variant traits? Independent evolution

likTraitPhylo: meserr does not appear to be used in the code - remove?
Also is this true?
"#' Note that \code{as.rateMatrix} calls the CAIC function \code{vcv.array} multiple times and this can be slow for large phylogenies (though faster than using the "ape" equivalent \code{vcv.phylo})." - is this used in the code?
